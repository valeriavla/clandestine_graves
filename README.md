# Geospatial analysis of clandestine graves detections using Reinforcement Learning

In this work, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for a geospatial analysis of clandestine graves in Mexico is presented. For law enforcement authorities and families 
looking for missing people, the issue of clandestine graves and the discovery of remains is a complicated and sensitive one. The goal of the study is to assess area reduction exploration and visualize common trajectories to find clandestine graves using RL. The work uses various techniques to increase the effectiveness of the RL model, including estimating state values, action values, and optimal policies and adding function approximators.
